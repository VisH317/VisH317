### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Sup! I'm a 15 year old indie developer from NJ, and coding is practically my life. I started programming when I was 7 years old, and hated it at first. I've grown to love most of it though (Not you Java).

check out my [twitter](https://twitter.com/Vishrut97442) and my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishrut-thoutam-246027245/)! Connect with me anytime if ur bored :)
